# Introduction

Implementation of Kmeans, SimpleKMeans and density-based method.

# SimpleKMeans

**1. Choose a set of attributes for clustering and give a motivation.
(Hint: always ignore attribute "name". Why does the name attribute need
to be ignored?)**

We choose attributes energy, fat, calcium as viewing values directly we
could understand that energy, protein and fat contribute more than other
attributes given. Name is always ignored because it is an identical
attribute and does not contribute during clustering.

**2. Experiment with at least two different numbers of clusters, e.g. 2
and 5, but with the same seed value 10.**

In first experiment, tried with cluster value as 2 and seed value as 10
for all attributes mentioned in the first questions answer.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("/Users/uday/Documents/GitHub/732a75/lab1/Cluster4Seed10.png")
```

In second experiment, tried with cluster value as 4 and seed value as 10
for all attributes mentioned in the first questions answer.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("/Users/uday/Documents/GitHub/732a75/lab1/Cluster4Seed10.png")
```

**3. Then try with a different seed value, i.e. different initial
cluster centers. Compare the results with the previous results. Explain
what the seed value controls.**

Changing seed value to 20.

Results of first experiment

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("/Users/uday/Documents/GitHub/732a75/lab1/Cluster2Seed20.png")
```

Results of second experiment

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("/Users/uday/Documents/GitHub/732a75/lab1/Cluster2Seed20.png")
```

**Comparison of results**

For Cluster 2

Cluster sum of squared error changed from 1.94879 -\> 1.93522.

For Cluster 4

Cluster sum of squared error changed from 0.6841 -\> 0.7243.

**Seed value** controls the initial cluster centers, which controls the
clustering.Different seed value results in different cluster formation
and squeared error values.

**4. Do you think the clusters are "good" clusters? (Are all of its
members "similar" to each other? Are members from different clusters
dissimilar?)**

Clusters are not properly good, as for k=2, the clustering is weak where
one cluster dominates the other for both cases of seed(10 or 20). When
k=4, the clustering is better and clusters are distributed more fairly
when compared to other k value for both the seed values.

**5. What does each cluster represent? Choose one of the results. Make
up labels (words or phrases in English) which characterize each
cluster.**

Below table shows the cluster distribution when k=4 and seed value is
10.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(knitr)

data <- data.frame(
  Cluster = c("0", "1", "2", "3"),
  Energy = c(341.875, 180, 100.7143, 180),
  Fat = c(28.875, 9.2727, 3.1429, 9),
  Calcium = c(8.75, 12.1818, 88, 367),
  Label = c(
    "High-Fat, Energy, calicum product",
    "Balanced Fat Energy Calcium product",
    "Rich Calcium Dairy Product",
    "High Calcium Product"
  )
)

kable(data, caption = "Cluster Labelling")
```

# MakeDensityBasedClusters

**1. Use the SimpleKMeans clusterer (which gave the result you haven
chosen in 5).Experiment with at least two different standard deviations.
Compare the results.**

Results of First Experiment:

where Standard deviation is 0.1, cluster distribution when k=4 and seed
value is 10.

**Comparison of results**

| Metric         | SD = 0.1  | SD = 1.0  |
|----------------|-----------|-----------|
| Log Likelihood | -12.03857 | -13.32433 |
| Cluster 0 Size | 9         | 8         |
| Cluster 1 Size | 9         | 10        |
| Cluster 2 Size | 8         | 8         |
| Cluster 3 Size | 1         | 1         |

(1) **Lower standard deviation (0.1)** leads to tighter density
    estimation and clearer cluster membership.

(2) **Higher standard deviation (1.0)** allows more flexibility, leading
    to broader densities and potentially more overlapping clusters.

(3) The choice of standard deviation affects both model fit (log
    likelihood) and instance assignments.

(4) For cleaner clustering with higher certainty, a lower SD is
    preferable; for flexibility and noise tolerance, a higher SD can be
    useful.
